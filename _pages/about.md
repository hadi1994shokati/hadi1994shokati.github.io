I am a **Soil Scientist** at the [University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/geowissenschaften/arbeitsgruppen/geographie/forschungsbereich/bodenkunde-und-geomorphologie/work-group/people-main-pages/doctoral-students/hadi-shokati/), Germany, combining **deep learning** and **remote sensing** to model soil and environmental processes in agriculture. I work with **UAV imagery, multi-spectral data, and advanced computational methods** to support precision agriculture and sustainable land management. I am proficient in deep learning, Python, and spatial data analysis, and I enjoy turning complex data into practical insights.

I am interested in:

- GIS, Remote and Proximal Sensing

- Soil Erosion and Soil Moisture Modelling

- Spatial Data Analysis and Machine Learning

- Photogerametry, Climate Change and Precision Agriculture


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
